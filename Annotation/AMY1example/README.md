The analysis and plotting script for resolving amylase1 using pangenome alleles.

AMY_major_mutant.py: generate mutant plots for amy1 alleles.

chromplot.py: generate haplotype plots for amy1 alleles, showing orders on all assembly haplotypes.

analysis2.py: investigated the extent to which diversity is represented by large haplotypes structures by determining the number of singleton haplotypes with unique paCNVs that could not be represented by remaining haplotypes during leave-one-out tests.
