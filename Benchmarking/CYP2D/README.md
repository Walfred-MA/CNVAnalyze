This is the benchmarking and plotting pipeline for CYP2D genes, for both ctyper and aldy.

mutant_cyp2d.py: make normal mutant plot for all cyp2d alleles

mutant_cyp2d_benchctyperfull.py: make benchmarking mutant plot for ctyper genotyping.

mutant_cyp2d_benchctyper_onlycyp2d6.py: make benchmarking mutant plot for ctyper genotyping, but only on the same region with aldy (CYP2D6 region)

mutant_cyp2d_benchaldy.py: make benchmarking mutant plot for aldy results. 

runaldy.sh: command of calling aldy.
