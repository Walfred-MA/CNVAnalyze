This is the alignment comprison to the original assemblies during leave-one-out analysis.

Leaveoneout_database: building the database excluding original assemblies for each hprc sample
Match: the matching script used to match genotyping results to original assemblies/GRCH38 alleles.
Align: the script to perform global pairwise alignment between genotyping results and original assemblies/GRCH38 alleles.

We ran three trials: one for leave-one-out, one for non-leave-one-out (script and pipeline is the same with leave-one-out, but ran with full database), and one for comprison to GRCH38.
