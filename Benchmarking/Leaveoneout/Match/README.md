This are scripts to match the genotyping results to original assemblies/GRCH38. 

ResultSummary.py: summary genotyping results base on ctyper output.
RegresstoRef.py: take the output from ResultSummary.py, then match genotyping results to GRCH38 alleles.
RegresstoOri.py: take the output from ResultSummary.py, then match genotyping results to original alleles.
